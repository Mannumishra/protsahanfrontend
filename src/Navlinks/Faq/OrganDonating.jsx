                ORGAN DONATION A GIFT OF LIFE

            <p>
              Organ transplants are miraculous achievements of modern medicine
              which provide a viable approach to the management of diseases that
              cause end stage organ failure. They help such patients live long
              after they have given up hope but depend entirely on the
              generosity of donors and their families who are willing to give
              this life saving gift to others. Every year, hundreds of people
              die while waiting for an organ transplant. There is a serious
              shortage of organs and the gap between the numbers of organs
              donated and the number of people waiting is ever increasing. This
              where you can help by pledging your organs
            </p>

              A single non-living heart beating donor can save 7 lives by
              donating the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas and small
              bowel. Several tissues like cornea, heart valves, ear drums and
              bones, menisci, tendons and skin could be donated. The
              Transplantation of Human Organs Act1994 (THOA) and the
              Transplantation of human organ rules 1995 (THOR) as amended in
              2002 provide for the regulation of removal, storage and
              transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes the act
              recognizes the concept of Brain Stem Death (BSD) and gives legal
              sanction for cadaver organ donation. As of now there is no
              organization at the national level to control and coordinate organ
              donation and organ sharing there are some organizations at the
              state level like ORBO (Organ Retrieval & Banking Organization) at
              AIIMS; New Delhi MOHAN (Multi Organ Harvesting And Networking)
              foundation at Chennai and ZTCC ( Zonal Transplant Co Ordination
              Committee) for Maharashtra.

                    Severe head injury, stroke, brain tumour or other damage
                    serious illnesses cause irreversible brina damage with
                    cessation of brain stem function and such a patient is
                    termed brain dead. A brain dead person is medically and
                    legally dead and cannot recover. With the help of artificial
                    support like mechanical ventilation and drugs, the heart may
                    continue to beat for a limited period of time but eventually
                    it will stop functioning despite any medical support. Brain
                    death is certified after specific tests are performed twice
                    over an interval of six hours by a team of 4 doctors as per

                      No. The doctors looking after a patient make every
                      possible effort to save the patientâ€™s life. If despite
                      efforts, the patient suffers brain, only then can organ
                      donation be considered and a completely different team of
                      doctors is called in. The patient is already dead and the
                      ventilator only keeps the body supplied with oxygen so
                      that heart can continue to beat and circulate blood to
                      preserve the organs so they can be donated for
                      transplantation.

                      Organ donation ensures that you leave behind a legacy of
                      life to others after you. Families of donors say that

                      for donation and help precious lives from being lost
                      before their time
